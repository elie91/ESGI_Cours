Good morning everyone, 
My name is Elie Bismuth, and I am a full stack web developer.
Today, I am going to present a very interesting topic, in the field of new technologies, which is: Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality


This presentation is summarized as follows:
I will begin by explaining what virtual reality is, as well as augmented reality.
Then weâ€™ll see where those technologies are being used
We will conclude the presentation by discussing the impact these technologies can have on our world and society

Virtual reality is the fact of immersing a user in a virtual environment, totally excluding from his field of vision the physical world
This virtual environment can be anything, like for example a fantasy world, an airplane, space etc.The user finds himself immersed in this virtual world

An example of a game using augmented reality is the Pokemon Go game, which met with great success during its release, 
which use your phone's camera to track your surroundings and overlay additional information on top of it, on the screen. 
Pokemon Go projects a Pokemon on your screen, on top of whatever the camera is looking at
